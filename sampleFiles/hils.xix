THE HILLS OF COMMERCE

0 21 sun floated 17 above 1 20 8 a beautiful ball 4 red- 
orange flame. I worried 12 a brief moment 28 1 20 catching 
fire, 13 a cool breeze brushed 73 6 cheek, assuring me 7 
1 20 10 in no danger. 

0 I grinned thinking 4 15 1 superstitions 7 must 43 grown 
up 26 1 sun 42 it 41 7 particular shade. But 1 56 
thing I 29 71 4 9 "Red sky at morning, sailor take warning. 
Red sky at night sailor's delight." 

0 My 70 5 taught me 7 ditty 8 along 27 1 "Thirty days 
hath September . . . mnemonic device 12 1 months. 21 two 10 
linked in 6 memory. 

0 Memory. Memory is a funny thing 8 contrary might be a better word 
12 it. It will remember 97 slight ever done you, 13 won't let 
you 71 4 1 word, name, place, or number 7 you want 66 now 
8 you 54 what I mean. 

0 Maybe it's 55 kind 4 deeply hidden genetic memory 7 keeps 
driving me 3 37 hills. These 38 23 6 70 grew up; 2 
11 mother; 2 11 mother. 

0 I 51 61 54 why I 9 trudging up 25 deeply rutted 
graveled path 3 see 25 old cemetery. None 4 6 kin 10 64 
63 8 17 a bunch 4 people named Anderson whose 56 connection 
3 6 68 9 1 coincidence 4 living 2 dying in 1 same town. 

0 21 cemetery 9 a jumble 4 different shaped 2 sized headstones. 
Some 5 34 installed fairly recently. These 82 78 79 me 
2 10 49 readable. Time, weather, 2 moss 5 not worn 1 
chiseled words 36 3 1 illegible ridges 7 remained on 1 91 
round-topped tilting stone markers 4 1 83 century. Weeds 5 grown 
up between 1 98 obscuring 1 shortest 60 8 testimony 3 
1 inattention 25 40 graveyard 5 suffered. 

0 "_The Anderson 68 must 43 5 55 money_," I thought, 48 
at 15 1 98 old 2 new. "All 1 Sanders' 29 manage 10 
large rocks at 1 head 4 1 graves." I envisioned 1 40 
graveyard on 6 cousin's farm 7 held 1 first two 104 4 
1 Sander's clan in Missouri: big Maple 2 Pecan 20 shading 1 
15 by 15 foot plot, two or three actual 98 2 nine or ten large 
rocks. No weeds grew up 26 37 graves, 12 15 7 no 24 49 
living knew exactly who 9 64 63 or where. My cousins made sure 
our relatives 10 well cared for. 

0 All 1 succeeding 104 4 Sanders 10 64 in Oakdale 
Cemetery 23 someone came by on a regular basis 3 mow 1 grass 2 
pull 1 weeds. 21 majority 4 1 80 5 headstones, an American 
flag flew on a pole at 1 center 4 1 cemetery, 2 1 74 VFW 
put 40 flags on 1 80 4 veterans 97 Veteran's Day. 

0 This 9 an "active" cemetery. I remembered 15 1 times 32 6 
life 7 I 5 attended grave 47 services at Oakdale: 6 mother's 
parents, 6 dad's father, several aunts 2 uncles, and, 1 latest, 
6 dad. 

0 Months 5 passed, 76 6 dad's death, 46 I 29 visit his 
grave. Now, I 92 more often, 13 1 grave I 92 most 9 
7 4 a woman I 5 62 met. 22 died seventeen years 46 I 
9 born, 13 I 52 drawn 3 11 8 To Emma 8 6 grandmother. 

0 I 52 pulled 3 visit Emma. 22 5 died young, 4 influenza, 2 
5 34 64 on 24 47 4 1 cemetery while 15 1 rest 4 11 
68 8 2 mine 5 34 64 on 1 opposite side. Not 56 5 
16 34 separated too early 14 11 family, 13 16 9 separated 
14 them 12 15 eternity. 

0 This 40 cemetery, 7 I 52 drawn 3 today, sat on top 4 a 
hill, enshrouded in 20 27 a two-foot-tall iron fence protecting 
it. 21 fence formed a 90 26 1 80 2 marker, 39 1 
90 4 life, 13 25 90 56 measured 28 twenty feet across. 

0 I 71 25 place reminded me 4 1 old grave 60 7 6 Uncle 
Dick showed me 2 6 dad 24 Sunday 42 I 9 a kid. 

0 My uncle led us 30 1 69 in 19 4 his 75 2 we 15 
tromped 76 him. All civilization 5 disappeared 42 we 101 
30 1 woods. 21 20 2 33 vegetation 10 so thick 7 17 
a few steps 83 1 edge you couldn't see 6 aunt 2 uncle's big two- 
story white wood-frame house. I 52 39 we 5 101 19 3 pre- 
Civil War days 42 6 great-great-grandparents 5 85 14 1 38 
4 Tennessee 3 1 38 4 Missouri 3 homestead 90 acres 2 raise a 
family. 

0 We wound 32 20 2 up 2 36 38 until 6 uncle 
93 2 pointed. I 18 in 1 direction he indicated at 1 47 
4 a 44 8 deep in gloom 14 1 thick tree cover even at midday 8 
2 saw 1 first rounded tombstone 7 18 39 it 5 started 
tumbling 36 1 hill, 13 5 34 frozen in mid tumble. 

0 We walked 59 3 1 area 2 suddenly 1 firm ground became soft, 
sinking 27 our weight 28 four inches, as we walked 59 ground 
41 up decades ago 12 1 last resting places 4 37 unknown 
people. I expected 3 see bones sticking out 4 1 47 4 1 hill, 
13 I guess 1 74 dogs 2 1 33 woodland animals 5 scattered 
those long ago. I 52 sad 7 no 24 5 cared 12 37 80 8 
7 no 24 except 6 uncle, knew 37 markers 10 here. 

0 We 61 stay long. 

0 I 18 out 32 1 20 2 noticed 7 1 sky 9 turning 
1 rose-pink 4 approaching dusk. I checked 6 watch 17 3 be sure 
8 I 5 28 an hour 46 dark. I 18 45 23 I thought 6 
uncle's 75 5 34 2 knew 7 I 5 3 find out if those grave- 
60 10 49 89 76 15 37 years. 

0 It 35 28 five minutes 3 drive 32 town 3 1 bottom 4 1 
44 23 7 white two-story 75 5 once 82 . . . 46 it 
burned down. I 35 off 30 1 99 86 up 1 44 3 take a 
perpendicular course 53 14 1 house. I 85 as fast as 1 dense 
underbrush 57 allow, glad 7 I 5 worn 6 jeans 2 6 black 91 
boots. 

0 After 17 a few hurried steps, I 5 3 slow 6 pace. Fallen 20 
leaned 73 living trees; I 29 climb 59 a few, 2 1 rest I 
5 3 skirt. Forced 3 slow 6 pace, I 35 1 time 3 67 100 
21 38 26 63 supported a wonderful variety 4 trees: Maple, 
Oak, Mulberry, Persimmon, 2 Sassafras. I wondered if either 4 6 
grandmothers 5 ever made sassafras tea. 

0 I 54 7 Granny Wise used 3 take 6 70 along 42 16 went 
out scouring 1 38 12 Polk 2 Dandelion greens. A person 29 
49 81 live off 1 land 26 here. Oops! My foot 5 slipped 
on something round. I 18 12 what I 5 101 on 2 saw 1 tough, 
round, 95 pod 7 protected ripening pecans. It's no wonder 7 6 
great-great 103 5 liked 25 area enough 3 move 63 14 
Tennessee. 

0 I 18 up 30 1 treetops as a squirrel jumped 14 24 tree 
3 another. 21 limbs 4 55 4 1 20 10 so close together 7 
31 18 39 a wooden suspension bridge. 21 74 critters 57 
43 a feast 46 too long, if 1 profusion 4 95 pecans 2 
95 persimmons 7 I 29 see decorating 1 upper-level bridge 
9 any indication 8 unless 55 4 1 74 human denizens 49 
ventured up 25 way. 

0 I 93 at 7 point 2 leaned 73 24 4 1 larger 20 
8 48 at 97 hillside 12 evidence 4 a fallen headstone, a 
broken piece 4 stone, anything 7 57 tell me I 9 in 1 66 
place. How I thought 7 76 15 25 time I 57 be able 3 17 
walk 66 3 1 spot 7 I 5 56 92 once 9 51 stupid. 
I hung 6 head, ready 3 turn 26 2 admit defeat. There 81 
94 anything left 3 find anyway. 

0 I lifted 6 head slowly 2 35 24 long, last 67 26 me. I 
41 almost a complete circle, gazing at 1 99 48 83 1 
trees, seeing wild ferns, Queen Anne's Lace, 2 33 things 7 10 
81 poisonous, 2 17 staring at 24 spot on 1 hillside, not 
51 seeing it. 

0 Then 6 eyes focused. There 9 something irregular 28 1 
hillside. I 35 a couple steps 45 it 12 a better 67 2 sank 
28 four inches 30 1 soil. I gasped 2 stopped. I 5 found it. 

0 I 18 up 1 47 4 1 44 2 saw a couple 33 60 
sticking out. 72 10 covered 27 moss 2 algae, 13 31 10 
unmistakably tombstones. 

0 I knelt 36 3 see it any inscription 9 left on 1 stone. I 5 
pencil 2 paper in 6 pocket (I 62 went anywhere without it), 13 
time 5 taken its toll 2 erased 25 soul's record completely. 

0 I sat on 6 heels 17 contemplating 1 60 2 1 69 12 a 
moment. Dusk 9 settling in 2 15 1 leaves 2 15 1 tree trunks 
10 turning 3 grey. I needed 3 start 19 so I wouldn't get stuck in 
1 69 in 1 dark. 

0 As I rose 3 6 feet, a movement 17 at 1 edge 4 6 vision 
caught 6 attention. I 41 3 look, 13 89 9 nothing there. 
Another movement made me 67 19 45 1 hill. Mist 9 forming. 
"_Great_," I thought. "_I 51 hate driving in 1 fog_." 21 84 
spread out 8 twining 26 1 trees, climbing 1 hillside. And 1 
temperature 5 dropped 8 I shivered 27 1 cold. 

0 A piece 4 1 84 broke 53 14 1 whole 2 drifted 45 
me. I 35 a step 19 8 53 14 1 84 8 2 sank again 30 1 
soft soil. My heart beat faster 8 I 50 3 run, 13 6 feet seemed 
3 43 put 36 roots. "Ah, come on, what am I afraid 4 8 a 40 
water vapor?" 

0 21 84 coalesced 30 a form. It 9 a 40 78 79 I 8 
*she* 9 a 40 78 79 I. Any composure 7 I 5 managed 3 
regain left me. I 50 3 scream, 13 15 4 1 moisture 5 34 
sucked 14 6 throat 2 tongue 8 6 heart 17 beat even faster 8 
2 louder. People in 1 next county 29 81 hear it. 

0 I 82 transfixed as 25 mist-woman's features 35 shape. 22 5 
a nice face 8 heartshaped 8 2 91 hair. 22 wore a simple dress 
7 reached almost 3 11 ankles. 22 57 43 34 66 in fashion 
27 55 4 1 30's dress designs I 5 seen. But 16 94 51 
78 79 me 8 16 17 happened 3 be floating 28 a foot off 1 
ground. 

0 I 18 19 at 11 88 22 5 sad eyes. I 50 3 ask 11 
why 16 9 so sad. Geez! When 5 I changed 14 terrified 3 
compassionate 8 I 9 48 at a ghost! 

0 But 16 5 6 grandmother's 88 A face I 5 56 seen in very 
few photographs. But 63 82 6 father's 70 8 who 5 died 42 
he 9 17 a teenager. I 50 3 touch her; I 50 3 talk 3 her; 
I 50 3 get 3 54 77 

0 Movement behind 11 drew 6 attention 53 12 a moment. Behind 11 
10 men 8 in uniforms 8 Civil War uniforms 8 86 100 Lots 
4 misty figures 10 86 15 26 me. 72 10 15 shapes 2 
sizes. None 4 1 others seemed 3 43 features 7 I 29 see. 
72 10 58 in closer 2 closer 3 me. This 94 interesting 
anymore. I 41 3 run. 

0 But 1 ghost 4 6 65 9 89 in front 4 me holding up 
11 hand 8 not 3 me 13 3 1 others. All 1 33 shapes 93 
58 12 a brief moment then began 58 53 14 me. 21 shapes who 
appeared 3 be in uniform began 3 file 83 us, 2 as 31 did, each 
24 57 salute us. Why 31 10 doing that, I don't 54 8 it 61 
matter. In 11 pictures, 6 65 5 always 18 shy 8 perhaps 
16 5 found courage in 1 next life. 

0 22 motioned 12 me 3 follow 11 2 I did. We climbed 1 44 
23 1 tombstones 10 2 then followed 1 44 36 'till I 9 
48 out 32 1 20 at houses 7 10 in town. 

0 I 35 a moment 3 realize 7 1 75 directly 96 14 me 
8 96 a small field 2 on 1 33 47 4 a road 8 9 23 6 
great-aunt Sally 5 lived. That meant I 9 behind 1 lot 23 Emma's 
home 5 been. 

0 I 18 59 at 11 image 2 wished we 5 55 33 means 3 
communicate. 

0 22 led me 19 32 1 99 pausing 2 pointing at plants 2 
at 1 Pecan 2 Sassafras trees. 22 must 43 roamed 37 hills, too, 
as 6 33 65 5 done, 48 12 plants 2 nuts 2 berries 
3 supplement 11 family's meager larder. 

0 I suddenly realized 7 it 9 completely dark except 12 1 faint 
lightness 4 1 misty creatures 7 10 49 slowly 58 100 

0 "I'll 62 find 6 way 19 3 6 car," I whispered 3 myself. 

0 My 65 85 2 I jerked 6 head 19 45 77 22 
reached 11 hand out, brushing 11 fingertips 73 6 cheek. It 
52 39 a cool, damp spiderweb. Then 16 motioned 12 me 3 follow 
77 

0 I 61 54 23 we 10 going, 13 I 61 want 3 lose 1 
contact I 5 established 27 77 When 16 stopped, I 18 3 
23 16 pointed 2 saw 7 we 10 at 1 edge 4 1 69 23 
I 5 entered, 2 I 29 see 6 car in 1 moonlight. 

0 I 41 19 3 thank her, 13 16 9 already 58 53 8 
dissipating as 16 went. Right 46 16 completely disappeared, a 
tall man's figure joined 11 7 18 39 6 103 . . . 2 
then 31 10 gone. 

0 I 41 45 6 car 8 tears streaming 36 6 88 

0 I'm not sure how I got 19 home 8 I don't remember 1 drive 19 
14 1 country. And now 7 I 9 19 in town, 1 whole thing 5 a 
certain unreal air 28 it. It 5 51 happened . . . I kept telling 
myself 7 . . . 59 2 over. 

0 I went 30 6 apartment, greeted 6 cat 2 sat 36 on 1 couch 
27 a book. I flipped 32 2 came 96 1 letter Chief Seattle 
wrote 3 1 governor 3 whom 1 chief's people 5 17 sold 87 
land. His words jumped off 1 page at me, 2 instead 4 being a threat, 
31 10 strangely comforting: 

00000 "Your dead cease 3 love you 2 1 land 4 87 
000000 nativity as soon as 31 pass 1 portals 4 1 
000000 tomb 2 wander way beyond 1 stars. 72 are soon 
000000 forgotten 2 62 return. Our dead 62 forget 1 
000000 beautiful world 7 gave them being . . . 37 shores 
000000 will swarm 27 1 invisible dead 4 6 tribe, 2 42 
000000 your children's children 71 themselves alone in 1 
000000 field, 1 store, 1 shop, upon 1 highway, or in 1 
000000 silence 4 1 pathless wood, 31 will not be alone...."
